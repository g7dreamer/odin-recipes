        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>What I love about this recipe, other than the ingredients (smoked salmon, pine nuts, yum!) is that it can be pulled together so quickly and it's not particularly heavy, as so many cream sauce pastas can be.</p>
        <p>There's also room for maneuvering; add more or less wine or cream to taste; leave out the pine nuts if you can't be bothered; add some asparagus or cream cheese if you want; use smoked trout or sturgeon instead of the salmon.</p>


        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) package penne pasta</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>½ onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder</li>
            <li>2 cups skim milk</li>
            <li>½ cup grated Romano cheese</li>
            <li>1 cup frozen green peas, thawed and drained</li>
            <li>½ cup canned mushrooms, drained</li>
            <li>10 ounces smoked salmon, chopped</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add penne and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes; drain.</li>
            <li>Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Sauté onion in butter until tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir flour and garlic powder into onion.</li>
            <li>Gradually stir in milk. Heat to just below boiling point, then gradually stir in cheese until sauce is smooth. Stir in peas and mushrooms; cook over low heat until warmed through, about 4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Toss in smoked salmon and cook until heated through, about 2 minutes. Serve over pasta.</li>
        </ol>
