        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This mushroom soup is creamy and rich — it's one of my favorite soups of all time and it's so easy! The long, slow caramelization of the mushrooms requires a little patience, but it really unlocks their magical flavor, which is the secret to this mushroom soup.</p>
        <p>You're bound to love the uniquely earthy and creamy flavor of Chef John's mushroom soup recipe. Garlic, cream, and fresh thyme join meaty caramelized mushrooms and diced onions for a rich, fragrant bowlful of homemade goodness. This comforting soup recipe makes an enticing appetizer course or stand-alone dish — experience the velvety swirls of flavor for yourself (and never buy the store-bought stuff again).</p>


        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>¼ cup unsalted butter</li>
            <li>2 (16 ounce) packages sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt</li>
            <li>1 medium yellow onion, diced</li>
            <li>1 ½ tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>6 sprigs fresh thyme, tied in a bundle with kitchen twine</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, peeled</li>
            <li>4 cups chicken broth, or more to taste</li>
            <li>1 cup water, or more to taste</li>
            <li>1 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
            <li>1 salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves for garnish, or to taste</li>

        
        </ul>
        

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt butter in a large soup pot over medium-high heat. Sauté mushrooms and 1 pinch salt in the melted butter until mushrooms release their juices, 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Reduce heat to medium-low and continue to cook, stirring often, until juices evaporate and mushrooms are caramelized, 15 to 25 minutes. Set aside a few attractive mushroom slices for garnish later, if desired.</li>
            <li>Add onion to the mushrooms; cook until onion is soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir flour into the mushroom mixture and cook, stirring often, to remove the raw flour taste, about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add thyme bundle and garlic cloves, then pour in 4 cups chicken broth and 1 cup water. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 1 hour. Remove and discard thyme bundle.</li>
            <li>Puree soup with an immersion blender until smooth and thick. Stir in cream. If too thick, add a little chicken broth or water. Season with salt and black pepper.</li>
            <li>Ladle into bowls, and garnish with reserved mushroom slices and thyme leaves.</li>

        </ol>

        <h2>Tips</h2>
        <p>Prep time assumes you are using pre-sliced mushrooms. If not, your prep time will be longer.</p>
        <p>If you don't have an immersion blender, puree the soup in a blender in small batches.</p>
